# nCovProject2020

## Abstract

### This project aims to devise a data-based model for Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) virus in mainland China to:

- Model the spacial dynamics of 2019-nCov
- Model the temporal dynamics of 2019-nCov
- Infer spacial and temporal trends for 2019-nCov
- Explore possibility of extending the devised model for arbitrary disease outbreak
- Develop a tool for spacial and temporal dynamics forecasting of future disease outbreaks for better disease response and containment
